00-Tool-templates Readme
========================

The purpose of the files in this folder is to provide some
"best practise" models for creating a tool for TCT.

How to use:

1. Select a file you find appropriate.

2. Make a copy.

3. To actually activate that tool rename it in a way that
   the name starts with the four-letter trigger sequence
   `run_`.
